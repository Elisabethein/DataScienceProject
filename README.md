# Heart Disease Prediction
#### Authors: Johanna Kasenurm, Elisabet Hein

## Motivation and goal of this project
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) heart diseases, also known as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are causing the most deaths around the world. CVDs include different heart and blood vessel-related diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). It is argued that CVDs are among the deadliest diseases in both developed and developing countries. According to WHO CVDs take an estimated 17.9 million lives each year which is about 32% of all deaths globally. However, the chance of survival is higher if the diagnosis is made early enough. The goal of this project is to predict which people are at risk of heart disease.
